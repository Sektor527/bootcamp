BootCamp
========

**BootCamp** is a Windows program (UI and console) that helps maintain and run
a collection of games. It takes care of program arguments, ISO files, and emulators if a game requires it.

No more fiddling around with -- and probably forgetting -- obscure startup options!

You have to provide your own games (it works best with older games, like those you can find on www.gog.com)
and enter them in the database. For each game, you can fill in a set of command line arguments, an ISO file,
a category (FPS, RTS, RPG, ...) and a platform (native windows, Dosbox, console emulator).

Once you have your database, you can activate any entry you want and BootCamp will launch it for you in
the proper emulator, with the necessary ISO, and all the command line parameters you specified.

It lets you sort, filter and search entries to quickly find back what you want.

**BootCamp** runs as a Windows UI application and as a console program.
