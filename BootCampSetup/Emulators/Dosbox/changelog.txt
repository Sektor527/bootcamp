Changelog
---------
1.1.2.7 (May 4 12h11)
GUI:
-Minor Bugfix : If a game's image had been deleted, the game wasn't editable.

1.1.2.6 (March 19 23h30)

Improvment (AutoConfig) : search for DOSBox' executable in Program Files if Portable Mode isn't active, not if AmpShell isn't in Program Files.

1.1.2.5 (March 3 10h30)

GUI:
- Minor Bugfix : "Run game setup" and "Small icons view" had the same keyboard shortcut. Modified to Ctrl+Shif+S for the later. "Tiles icons view" changed to Ctrl+Shift+T for consistency.


1.1.2.4 (February 24 17h45)

GUI on GNU/Linux:
- MAJOR fix for this OS only : AmpShell stopped to be ugly with oversized forms. Thanks the Mono FAQ.
_This fix doesn't break anything on Windows._

The fonts' text color of the menues are still a problem on GNU/Linux (white/nearly transparent!).
No fix found yet...

1.1.2.3 (January 31 10h55)

GUI :
- Minor bugfix : the Setup path was always said to be "none" in the status bar.

1.1.2.2 (January 30 11h00)

Code improvments :
- Minor bugfix (once again) : a new game was still created even if it's name was missing (minor because it could be edited, and it didn't broke anything)
- More intelligent initial directory search when looking for a game's files.

GUI :
- 'quit on exit' available, even if the game's main executable is a batch file.
- Minor bugfix (once again) : On GNU/Linux the "Save and apply" button wasn't visible when editing a game. Really hopefully fixed this time...


1.1.2.1 (January 25 18h00)
Code modifications :
- Minor Bugfix : If AmpShell was closed while being minimized _and_ if "Remember window position" was enabled, it would set it's location off-screen on the next run. The workaround was to set it to fullscreen via the context menu of the window's title on the Windows' task bar.

GUI :
- Added 'Edit default configuration' to the tool bar.
- Added a Edit, toolbar, and context menu button to make a custom configuration file for the selected game(s) automagicly.
- Minor Bugfix : On GNU/Linux the "Save and apply" button wasn't visible when editing a game. Hopefully fixed...

Features:
- "Make config file" :
It just copies the default DOSBox configuration file into the game's directory, and set it as the game's custom config file.

Removed :
- All that Christmas code & images nonsense. ;-)

1.1.2.0 (January 4 2010 - 18h15) "Very Late Christmas Edition" (see the AboutBox... ;-) )

Code modifications :
- Bugfix : The Tile view works again. Regression since previous version (v1.1.1.0)
- Bugfix : The changes in the categories' order (wich can be done in the preferences) are now made only if the "Save and apply" button is clicked.
- Code : Lots of code clean up everywhere.

GUI :
- Improved AmpShell's icon : Displays OK in all the Windows' Explorer view modes (tiles, list, details, small icons, large icons).
- Changed a few icons to use those already in use elsewhere. Changed the "run game" icon for a nicer (but close) one.
- Updated status bar messages when a game is selected to include setup executable path and mounting options.

Features :
- The size of the columns are now remembered for the detailed view of each category.
- Tools menu -> Edit default configuration button
- Way more portability : 
-- DOSBox's executable, a defaut configuration file, and a default DOSBox language file are always searched for in AmpShell's directory. Was only done in v1.1.0.0 if they was no AmpShell.xml file already in the user's 'Application Data' directory.
-- Games' files locations (_if they are in the same directory as AmpShell, eventually in a subdirectory_) are now independant of the portable media (ie. USB key, portable HDD, ...) mount point.
-- A 'Portable Mode' in the Preferences makes the research of games' files, ISOs, and DOSBox' files in the same directory as AmpShell.

_In Portable Mode, ALL files MUST be in the same directory as AmpShell, or (eventually) in a subdirectory._
They are searched for when the Portable Mode has been activated, or when the user clicks on the 'Re-scan' button.

- An AmpShell + DOSBox 'portable pack' (AmpShell and DOSBox together, along with a default DOSBox configuration file, and a 'Games' empty sub-directory) is now available on the website. The included DOSBox files are the Windows version.

1.1.1.0 (December 18 00h55)
- Feature : AmpShell is now a portable application. Meaning it can be run from anywhere! :)

-> The user data file 'AmpShell.xml' will be created in the same directory as AmpShell if it isn't in Program Files (otherwise it is, as always, in Documents and Settings\<UserAccount>\Application Data\AmpShell).

-> If there's already data about games on the computer in the 'Application Data' directory, it will be copied in the same folder as AmpShell (if there isn't already AmpShell.xml alongside AmpShell.exe). 

- Feature : Added all the others columns to the 'details' view. Besides the games' names, there is now : Executable Path, Directory mounted as C:, Setup Executable Path, Custom Configuration Path, Drive or image file mounted as D: (or A: for a floppy disk image), Mounting Options, Additionnal Commands, No Console, Fullscreen, Quit on exit

- UI update : Updated the image file select dialog in the Game add/edit window to search also for *.img files (also supported by DOSBox)

1.1.0.9 (December 14 18h00)
- Minor bugfix : a new game or category was still created even if it's name was missing (minor because it could be edited, and it didn't broke anything)
- Cosmetics : Normalized the error message box wich is displayed when an user tries to add a new category with no name. 

1.1.0.8 (December 14 10h30)
- Fixed : Drag & Drop is now working perfectly (at last!). Contains too bugfixes:
-- Items can be dragged from newly created categories without having to restart AmpShell
-- Setting the display in the newly created category (_with a dropped game in it_) to 'list' or 'details' now works
- Bugfix : The 'All of them' button in the Preferences didn't work : The last bugfix about that was only partial (oops!)
- Bugfix : The 'None' button in the game's edit/create window wasn't working.

1.1.0.7 (December 11 23h50)
- Bugfix : The 'All of them' preferences for the categories' default view mode was not saved. Regression since v1.1.0.5
- Minor UI fix (again) : The game executable file location dialog display of searched file types ("*.bat;*.cmd;*.com;*.exe") was borked (although it worked!)
- Minor bugfix : The 'quit on exit" preference was taken into account when creating a new game, but not saved for the newly created game.

1.1.0.6 (December 2 18h34)
- Bugfix : The Preferences were not saved. Regression since previous release (v1.1.0.5)

1.1.0.5 (December 1 19h02)
-Bugfix : The "don't save" button _did_ save the changes (everywhere)!
-UI fix : The game executable file location dialog display of searched file types ("*.exe;*.bat;*.com") was borked (although it worked!)
-UI fix : The default game icon is now displayed as a 64*64 pixels image in the Add/Edit game window.
-Feature : IOCTL can be used with the CD drive mounted as D: ("-usecd 0 -ioctl" will be used). Or, if it's an image, it can be mounted as A: (floppy disk). Or none of both.
- Various small optimizations
- Some MessageBoxes normalizations.


1.1.0.4 (November 19 21h45)
-Feature: Added keyboard shortcuts to all menues' items
-Feature: Added help messages displayed in the status bar
-Feature: Added a View menu
-Cosmetics : changed the "icon view" text to "Default view" in Preferences -> Categories tab to avoid misinterpretation
-Bugfix : Drag & Drop was not using games' icons (only text was displayed until restart)
-Bugfix : New category drag & drop didn't work until restart
-Cosmetics : The UI look is now fixed. It looks much nicer (updated screenshots).
No more ugly uneeded pixel space (or lack of) between "Don't save"/"Don't add it"/"Save and apply" text and the button's icon.
No more "Save and apply" buttons' location change in the CategoryForm and GameForm windows (compared to the original "Add this category"/"Add this game" buttons' location). Yay! :-)

- Bugfix : when a game was added with no user icon selected, the default icon was not used (only text was displayed)
- Bugfix : The default directory to open when looking for CD images is now opened when creating a game even if the game's directory is known.
- Bugfix : If a custom icon is set for a game in creation, the directory of the icon can be opened when looking for the game's executable, setup executable, and custom configuration (because usually, a game's icon is inside it's installation directory).

1.1.0.0 (November 10 19h14) "Let's Play!"
After a few months of work on my free time, it's finally out!

- Ability to set an user icon for all games (can be reseted to the default one)
- New view modes for all categories (Large icon, Small icon, Tile, List, Details)
-Added icons on controls everywhere (sexy!), changed a few other icons.

-Default directory to open when looking for CD images
-Categories can be rearranged, and even sorted by name
-Default view mode for new categories (or all of them)
-Remember : Window position, Window size
-Prompt when : deleting a game, deleting a category
-Show (or not) : Menu bar, Tool bar, Status bar
-Moved DOSBox files (executable, global config file, language file) settings to the preferences window instead of the Tools menu

- New application icon, new AboutBox logo

Future Plans (v1.1.1.x) :
- Use of Windows 7's JumpLists (thanks to the WindowsAPICodePack)
- easy traduction of the UI with a simple xml file (eventually..)

1.0.3.6 (October 3 15h48)

1.0.3.4 (August 27 17h45)

1.0.3.3 (August 17 20h10)
- UI fix (GNU/Linux) : "Save and apply" text button now fully displayed when a game is edited
- UI cosmetic fixes
- Optimization : the for...each loop (wich finds wich game's custom configuration file is about to be edited) now breaks when the user's text editor is launched.
- Code refactoring : AmpShell's inner C# classes for XML (de)serialization are far more simple now. This make the executable and the memory usage smaller, too.

1.0.3.2 (August 15 12h10)
- Cosmetics : "OK" "Cancel" buttons' text replaced with more meaningful texts, such as "Add this game" "don't add", etc. ...
- UI design : Tab Indexes properly set for all forms. Just use the tab key to see it.

1.0.2.6 (August 8 00h33)
- Feature : You can use now your own text editor to modify config files of your games from inside AmpShell (wether with the Edit menu or with the context menu). Of course, this applies only to games for wich a custom DOSBox configuration file is set.
- Feature : AmpShell searches for mousepad,gedit,kate, and notepad, and use the first one found as the default text editor if no text editor is set.
- Feature : The path to the text editor's executable can be set in "Edit -> Preferences..." along with optional parameters the user might want to use.
- Optimization : AmpShell's executable size reduced to 412 KB instead of 492 KB. Minimal memory use for such a .NET project too.

1.0.2.5 (July 25 2009 01h45)
- Code refactoring : Just an unique string of random numbers is used as a signature now
for games and categories (no longer the MD5 hash of this signature)
- code refactoring / bug prevention : Generation of such signatures are now _not_ a .GenerateHash (or .GenerateSignature)
method of the class Category, but a lot nicer (and shorter) code in Main.cs : an IsItUnique private method, and do...while loops.
- "titre" XmlAttribute of the class Category replaced by "Title". Conversion (: retro-compatibility) code added on DSF_Load to preserve user data
- Code cleaning : properties-like code remove from the AddChild and RemoveChild method of the class AmpShell

- Bugfix : run/edit/delete game buttons were enabled when a tab was selected after a game had been selected.

1.0.2.3 (July 13 2009 02h50)
- Bugfix : If a game with an executable was edited, both the game executable location and the game directory mounted as 'C:' (textboxs and browse buttons) were not enabled

1.0.2.2 (July 12 2009 23h35)
- Bugfix : game executable versus game directory : When a game directory to be mounted as C: is chosen, the textbox and Browse buttons to choose the game's executable are disabled. 
If the textbox of the game directory is emptied, they become enabled.
Same mechanic was already implemented for the other way around.
